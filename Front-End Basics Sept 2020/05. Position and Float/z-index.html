                So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad. Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had. ‘Cause you ain't
                never met nobody like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. I'ma make you learn to
                appreciate me, differentiate me. From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake G’s. Skip over the "huggy
                bear," and all the "kissy face," please.
