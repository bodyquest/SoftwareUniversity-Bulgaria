                    I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod,
                    back nod. The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the
                    trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard,
                    Asgard. I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to. See Marshall no more, they want Shady,
                    I'm chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya. A little bit of weed
                    mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I
                    get shocked at the hospital.
