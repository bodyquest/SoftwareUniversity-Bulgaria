            Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?. I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?. We're gonna have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than before.

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?
