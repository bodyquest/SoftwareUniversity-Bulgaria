            Can't you see what you do to me, baby?. You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac. I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick. You're truly the only one who can do this to me. You just make me get so crazy. I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic. One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex.

            I’m the American Dream. I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’. I’m right back on 'em. With a (chicka chicka chicka) I can’t call it. Same shit, different toilet. Oh, you got a nice ass, darling. Can’t wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin. What you mean we ain't fuckin’? You take me for a friend?. Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin.

            I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to. See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya. A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital.

Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.

            I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter. But I thought a song would probably be a little better. Instead of a ,letter. That you'd probably just shred up--yeah. I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of. How much of a waste it'd ,be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd rather let you see how. Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle.

            When you walked through the door. It was clear to me (Clear to me). You’re the one they adore. Who they came to see (Who they came to see). You’re a rock star (Baby). Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you). Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?). We’re the ones who made you.
