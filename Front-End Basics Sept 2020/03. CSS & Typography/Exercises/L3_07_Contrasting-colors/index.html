            I’m the American Dream. I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’. I’m right back on 'em. With a (chicka chicka chicka) I can’t call it. Same shit, different toilet. Oh, you got a nice ass, darling. Can’t wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin. What you mean we ain't fuckin’? You take me for a friend?. Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin.

            So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad. Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had. ‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me. From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake G’s. Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please.

            I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody, come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road.
