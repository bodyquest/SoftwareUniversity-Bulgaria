                    My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window.
                    And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It
                    reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.

                    We're gonna have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on
                    the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than
                    before.

                    Feminist women love Eminem. "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him,
                    walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute
                    though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's
                    goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.
