Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.

That you'd probably just shred up--yeah. I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of. How much of a waste it'd ,be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd rather let you see how. Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle.
